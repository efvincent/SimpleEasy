    Evaluation

    Compare the rules to in Figure 1 reveals that the implementation
    is mostly straight forward.

    Substitution is handled by passing around an environment of values. Since 
    bound variables are represented as integers, the environment is just a list
    of values where the i-th position corresponds to the value of variable @i@.
    We add a new element to the environment whenver evaluating underneath a 
    binder, and lookup the correct element using Haskell's list lookup operator
    @!!@ when we encounter a bound variable.
